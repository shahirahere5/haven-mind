    content: `Stress is a natural response, but chronic stress can affect your mental and physical health. Here are practical strategies:\n\n• Practice deep breathing — 4-7-8 technique: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8\n• Break tasks into smaller steps to avoid feeling overwhelmed\n• Set boundaries with work and social obligations\n• Move your body — even a 10-minute walk can reduce cortisol levels\n• Write it out — journaling helps externalize worries\n\nRemember: managing stress is not about eliminating it entirely, but learning to flow with it.`,

    preview: "Writing isn't just for writers. Discover how putting pen to paper can reduce anxiety, improve clarity, and help you understand your emotional patterns.",
    category: "Mental Health",
    readTime: "5 min read",
    content: `Journaling has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. Here's why it works:\n\n• Emotional release — writing creates a safe outlet for feelings you might not express otherwise\n• Pattern recognition — over time, you'll notice recurring themes in your thoughts\n• Problem solving — writing about challenges engages different parts of your brain\n• Gratitude amplification — noting positive moments trains your brain to notice more of them\n• Better sleep — a "brain dump" before bed can quiet racing thoughts\n\nStart small: even 5 minutes a day makes a difference. There's no right or wrong way to journal.`,

    category: "Self-Care",
    readTime: "3 min read",
    content: `Your mood responds to small, intentional actions throughout the day:\n\n• Morning sunlight — just 10 minutes of natural light helps regulate your circadian rhythm\n• Hydration — dehydration is linked to increased anxiety and irritability\n• Social connection — even a brief, genuine conversation can lift your spirits\n• Nature exposure — green spaces reduce mental fatigue\n• Creative expression — drawing, cooking, or music engages positive neural pathways\n• Acts of kindness — helping others produces a natural mood boost\n\nTrack your mood daily to discover what activities correlate with feeling better.`,

    category: "Growth",
    readTime: "4 min read",
    content: `The key to lasting change is starting impossibly small:\n\n• The 2-minute rule — any new habit should take less than 2 minutes to start\n• Habit stacking — attach new habits to existing ones ("After I pour my coffee, I'll write one sentence in my journal")\n• Environment design — make good habits easy and bad habits hard\n• Don't break the chain — consistency matters more than intensity\n• Celebrate tiny wins — your brain needs positive reinforcement\n\nExamples of micro-habits for mental health:\n• One deep breath before checking your phone\n• Naming one thing you're grateful for while brushing your teeth\n• A 30-second body scan before sleep`,
